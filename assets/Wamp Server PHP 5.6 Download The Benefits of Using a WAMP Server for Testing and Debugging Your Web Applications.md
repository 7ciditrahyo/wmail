## Step 1: Download WAMP Server
 
The first step is to download WAMP server from its official website[^1^] or from GitHub[^2^]. You can choose between 32-bit and 64-bit versions depending on your system architecture. The download file is a zip archive that contains everything you need to set up WAMP server.

## Step 2: Extract WAMP Server
 
The next step is to extract the zip file to a location of your choice. For example, you can extract it to D:\HOST. You will see a folder called WAMP with several subfolders inside it. These subfolders contain the Apache, MySQL and PHP files.
 
## Step 3: Install WAMP Server
 
To install WAMP server, you need to run the wamp.bat file as administrator. This file is located in the WAMP folder. You can right-click on it and select "Run as administrator". The wamp.bat file will automatically install WAMP server and create two Windows services: Apache2.4 and MySQL. These services will start on demand by default, but you can change them to start automatically if you want.
 
## Step 4: Test WAMP Server
 
To test if WAMP server is working properly, you can open your web browser and type http://localhost in the address bar.
