# How to Test CSRF Vulnerability in Websites with CSRFTester Tool
 
CSRFTester is a free and open source tool for testing CSRF vulnerability in websites. CSRF stands for Cross-Site Request Forgery, which is an attack where the victim is tricked into loading information from or submitting information to a web application for which they are currently authenticated. The web application has no way of verifying the integrity of the request, so it may perform actions that the victim did not intend.
 
CSRFTester is developed by OWASP, which is a non-profit organization that aims to improve the security of web applications. CSRFTester allows you to make GET or POST requests to a target website, add parameters to the request, and open the result in an iframe or in a new tab/window. You can also view the request and response headers, cookies, and body.

To use CSRFTester, you need to download the zip file from [here](http://www.toolwar.com/2013/12/csrftester-csrf-vulnerability-tester.html) [^1^] and extract it to a folder. Then, you need to run the app.js file with Node.js, which is a JavaScript runtime environment. You can download Node.js from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/). After running app.js, you can access CSRFTester from your browser at http://localhost:3000.
 
Alternatively, you can use a web-based version of CSRFTester hosted on GitHub Pages at [here](https://sergioccrr.github.io/csrf-tester/) [^2^]. This version does not require any installation or configuration, but it may not work with some websites that do not allow to be called in an iframe.
 
To test a website for CSRF vulnerability, you need to enter the URL of the website in the Target field, choose the method (GET or POST), add any parameters you want to send with the request, and click on Send Request. You can also choose whether to open the result in an iframe or in a new tab/window. You can then observe the outcome of the request and see if it performed any unwanted actions on behalf of the victim.
 
For example, if you want to test if a website allows you to change your password without verifying your current password, you can enter the URL of the password change page in the Target field, choose POST as the method, add parameters such as new\_password and confirm\_password with some values, and click on Send Request. If the result shows that your password has been changed successfully, then the website is vulnerable to CSRF attacks.
 
CSRFTester is a useful tool for testing CSRF vulnerability in websites, but it does not guarantee that a website is secure or insecure. It is always recommended to use other methods and tools to verify the security of web applications. You can also learn more about CSRF attacks and how to prevent them from [here](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/csrf).
  
CSRF attacks can have serious consequences for both the victims and the web applications. For example, a CSRF attack can allow an attacker to transfer money from the victim's bank account, change the victim's email settings, post messages on the victim's social media accounts, or delete the victim's data. CSRF attacks can also damage the reputation and trust of the web applications that are affected by them.
 
There are several ways to prevent CSRF attacks on web applications. One of the most common and effective methods is to use a CSRF token, which is a random and unique value that is generated by the server and sent to the client along with the form or request. The client then has to send back the same token with the request, and the server has to verify that the token matches. This way, the server can ensure that the request is coming from a legitimate source and not from a malicious third-party.

Another method to prevent CSRF attacks is to use the SameSite attribute for cookies, which is a flag that tells the browser whether to send the cookie along with cross-site requests or not. The SameSite attribute can have three values: Strict, Lax, or None. Strict means that the cookie will only be sent with same-site requests, Lax means that the cookie will be sent with same-site requests and some cross-site requests (such as GET requests), and None means that the cookie will be sent with all cross-site requests. The None value requires that the cookie also has the Secure attribute, which means that it will only be sent over HTTPS connections.
