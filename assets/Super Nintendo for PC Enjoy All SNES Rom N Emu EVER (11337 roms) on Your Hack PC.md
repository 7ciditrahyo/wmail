If you are a fan of retro gaming, you might want to play some of the classic Super Nintendo games on your PC. The Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES) was a 16-bit video game console that was released by Nintendo in 1990. It had a library of over 700 games, many of which are considered to be among the best of all time.

Fortunately, you can enjoy these games on your PC with the help of emulators and ROMs. Emulators are software programs that mimic the hardware and software of a console, allowing you to run its games on your PC. ROMs are files that contain the data of a game cartridge, which you can load into an emulator.
 
There are many emulators and ROMs available online, but not all of them are reliable or legal. In this article, we will show you how to find and use some of the best emulators and ROMs for Super Nintendo games on your PC.
 
## Step 1: Choose an Emulator
 
The first step is to choose an emulator that suits your needs and preferences. There are many Super Nintendo emulators out there, but some of the most popular and accurate ones are:
 
- **Snes9x**: This is a great emulator that has ports for several systems, including Windows, Mac, Linux, Android, and iOS. It has a user-friendly interface and supports many features, such as save states, cheats, filters, netplay, and more. You can download it from [The Emulator Zone](https://www.emulator-zone.com/snes/) [^1^].
- **higan**: This is another emulator that focuses on accuracy and emulation quality. It can emulate multiple systems besides the SNES, such as the NES, Game Boy, Game Boy Advance, Sega Master System, Sega Genesis, and more. However, it requires a powerful PC to run smoothly. You can download it from [its official website](https://byuu.org/emulation/higan/).
- **RetroArch**: This is not an emulator per se, but a frontend for various emulators that use the Libretro API. It allows you to run games from different consoles with a unified interface and configuration. It also supports many features, such as shaders, rewind, achievements, online multiplayer, and more. You can download it from [its official website](https://www.retroarch.com/).

Once you have chosen an emulator, download it and extract it to a folder on your PC. You may need to install some additional software or drivers depending on the emulator.
 
## Step 2: Find and Download ROMs
 
The next step is to find and download ROMs for the games you want to play. ROMs are files that contain the data of a game cartridge, which you can load into an emulator. However, downloading ROMs without owning the original game is illegal in most countries, so we do not condone or encourage piracy.

If you own the original game cartridges and have the means to dump them into ROM files, you can do so legally. Otherwise, you will have to find ROMs online at your own risk. There are many websites that offer ROMs for download, but some of them may contain viruses or malware. Some of them may also offer hacked or modified versions of games (ROM hacks), which may not work properly or have unwanted changes.
 
One of the websites that claims to have a complete collection of SNES ROMs is [Archive.org](https://archive.org/details/SuperNintendofull_rom_pack) [^2^]. It offers a torrent file that contains 11337 SNES ROMs in ZIP format. However, we cannot guarantee the quality or legality of these ROMs.
 
To download these ROMs, you will need a torrent client such as [qBittorrent](https://www.qbittorrent.org/). Once you have installed it, open the torrent file with it and
