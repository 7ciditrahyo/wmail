The book aims to teach the concepts and applications of data structures using the C programming language in a simple and easy-to-understand manner. The book covers the syllabus of B.E., B.Tech, DOEACC Society, IGNOU and other courses that require data structures as a subject.
 
The book contains 524 pages and is divided into 16 chapters. Each chapter starts with a brief introduction of the topic, followed by theory with examples and diagrams. The book also provides step-by-step descriptions of writing programs using data structures in C. The book covers topics such as arrays, stacks, queues, linked lists, trees, graphs, sorting, searching, hashing and file structures. The book also includes exercises and multiple choice questions at the end of each chapter to test the understanding of the readers.

In this section, we will give a brief overview of some of the topics covered in the book Data Structures Through C In Depth.
 
## Arrays
 
An array is a collection of data elements of the same type, stored in contiguous memory locations. Arrays are one of the simplest and most commonly used data structures in C. Arrays can be used to store and manipulate data such as numbers, characters, strings, etc. Arrays can be declared using the syntax:
 `data_type array_name[size];` 
where data\_type is the type of the elements in the array, array\_name is the name of the array and size is the number of elements in the array. For example:
 `int marks[10];` 
declares an array of 10 integers named marks. The elements of an array can be accessed using the index operator [], which starts from 0. For example:
 `marks[0] = 85;` 
assigns the value 85 to the first element of the array marks. Arrays can also be initialized at the time of declaration using curly braces . For example:
 `int marks[10] = 85, 76, 90, 82, 95, 88, 79, 92, 84, 87;` 
initializes the array marks with the given values. Arrays can be passed to functions as parameters using the array name without brackets. For example:
 `void display(int marks[], int size);` 
declares a function that takes an array of integers and its size as parameters. Arrays can also be returned from functions using pointers. For example:
 `int* create_array(int size);` 
declares a function that returns a pointer to an array of integers of a given size.
 
## Stacks
 
A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last In First Out (LIFO) principle. A stack can be visualized as a pile of plates, where only the topmost plate can be accessed at any time. A stack can be implemented using an array or a linked list. A stack has two basic operations: push and pop. Push adds an element to the top of the stack and pop removes and returns the element from the top of the stack. A stack can also have other operations such as peek, which returns the element at the top of the stack without removing it, and isEmpty, which checks if the stack is empty or not.
 
A stack can be declared using a structure that contains an array or a pointer to a linked list and a variable to store the top index or pointer. For example:
 `// Stack using array
struct stack 
    int arr[MAX_SIZE]; // MAX_SIZE is a constant
    int top;
;

// Stack using linked list
struct node 
    int data;
    struct node* next;
;

struct stack 
    struct node* top;
;` 
A stack can be initialized by setting the top index or pointer to -1 or NULL respectively. For example:
 `// Stack using array
struct stack s;
s.top = -1;

// Stack using linked list
struct stack s;
s.top = NULL;` 
A stack can be implemented using functions that perform push and pop operations on the stack. For example:
 `// Stack using array
void push(struct stack* s, int x) 
    if (s->top == MAX_SIZE - 1) 
        printf("Stack overflow\n");
        return;
    
    s->top++;
    s->arr[s->top] = x;

int pop(struct stack* s) 
    if (s->top == -1) 
        printf("Stack underflow\n");
        return -1;
    
    int x = s->arr[s->top];
    s->top--;
    return x;

// Stack using linked list
void push(struct stack* s, int x) 
    struct node* new_node = (struct node*)malloc(sizeof(struct node));
    if (new_node == NULL) 
        printf("Stack overflow\n");
        return;
    
    new_node->data = x;
    new_node->next = s->top;
    s->top = new_node;

int pop(struct stack* s) {
    if (s->top == NULL) 
        printf("Stack underflow\n");
        return -1;
