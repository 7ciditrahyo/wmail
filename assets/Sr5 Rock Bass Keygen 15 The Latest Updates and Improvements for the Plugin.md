## 1. Choose the right playing mode
 
SR5 Rock Bass 2 has two playing modes: SPI (Super Performance Instrument) and Normal. SPI mode is designed to enable you to play ultra-realistic bass guitar performances in real-time, using various key switches and controllers to access different playing techniques and expressions. Normal mode is more suitable for simple bass lines or editing MIDI data in your DAW. You can switch between the two modes by clicking on the SPI button on the top left corner of the interface.
 
In SPI mode, you can use the following key switches and controllers to control the sound:
 
- Z: Legato slide (slow)
- X: Legato slide (medium)
- C: Legato slide (fast)
- V: Single note (no slide)
- B: Hammer-on & Pull-off
- N: Repetition
- M: Mute
- Mod wheel: Picking noise
- A-G#: String select
- 1-9: Add-on sounds (harmonics, fret noise, etc.)
- 0: Stop key
- -: Hold key
- =: Tap key
- Backspace: Position change noise
- \: Strum noise
- ]: Special FX

In Normal mode, you can use the following key switches and controllers to control the sound:

- Z-X: Velocity range select (low-high)
- C-V: Slide speed select (slow-fast)
- B-N: String select (1-5)
- M-\: Add-on sounds (harmonics, fret noise, etc.)
- Mod wheel: Picking noise

## 2. Adjust the tuning and tone
 
SR5 Rock Bass 2 allows you to adjust the tuning and tone of each string individually or globally. You can access these settings by clicking on the Global button on the top right corner of the interface. You can also use the Tune knob on each string panel to fine-tune each string by +/- 50 cents.
 
You can tune each string up or down by up to 4 semitones, which means you can play as low as G on the lowest string. This is useful for genres that require lower tunings, such as metal or djent. However, keep in mind that lower tunings may affect the realism and quality of some playing techniques and noises.
 
You can also adjust the tone of each string by using the Tone knob on each string panel. This knob controls the balance between the direct signal and the processed signal of each string. By turning it clockwise, you can get a brighter and more aggressive sound. By turning it counter-clockwise, you can get a warmer and softer sound.
 
## 3. Use the effects and amp simulator
 
SR5 Rock Bass 2 has a built-in effects processor and amp simulator that can enhance your bass sound with various effects and amp models. You can access these settings by clicking on the FX button on the top right corner of the interface.
