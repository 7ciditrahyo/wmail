In this article, we will show you how to use SARDU 3.0 to create a multiboot USB drive with Windows 10, Linux Mint and Hiren's Boot CD. You will need a USB drive with at least 16 GB of space and a working internet connection.
 
## Step 1: Download and install SARDU 3.0
 
You can download SARDU 3.0 from its official website[^1^]. There are two versions available: free and pro. The free version has some limitations such as the number of supported ISO files and the absence of some features such as QEMU emulator and ISO downloader. The pro version costs Ã¢Â‚Â¬29.90 and offers more options and functionalities.
 
After downloading the SARDU installer, run it and follow the instructions to install the software on your computer. You will need to accept the license agreement and choose a destination folder.
 
## Step 2: Run SARDU 3.0 and select your USB drive
 
After installing SARDU, run it as administrator and you will see the main interface of the software. It has four tabs: Windows, Linux, Utilities and Extra.

The first thing you need to do is to select your USB drive from the drop-down menu at the bottom left corner of the window. Make sure you have backed up any important data on your USB drive before proceeding, as it will be formatted during the process.
 
## Step 3: Add ISO files to your USB drive
 
Now you need to add the ISO files of the operating systems and tools that you want to include in your multiboot USB drive. You can do this in two ways: either by downloading them directly from SARDU or by adding them manually from your computer.
 
To download them from SARDU, go to the tab that corresponds to the type of ISO file you want (Windows, Linux or Utilities) and click on the green arrow next to the name of the ISO file. This will open a browser window where you can download the ISO file from its official source. After downloading it, SARDU will automatically add it to your USB drive.
 
To add them manually from your computer, go to the tab that corresponds to the type of ISO file you want (Windows, Linux or Utilities) and click on the folder icon next to the name of the ISO file. This will open a file explorer window where you can browse your computer and select the ISO file that you have already downloaded or copied from another source. After selecting it, SARDU will automatically add it to your USB drive.
 
In this example, we will add Windows 10, Linux Mint and Hiren's Boot CD to our multiboot USB drive.
 
## Step 4: Customize your multiboot USB drive
 
After adding all the ISO files that you want to your USB drive, you can customize some settings and options for your multiboot USB drive. To do this, go to the Extra tab and click on the Settings button at the bottom right corner of the window.
 
This will open a new window where you can change some parameters such as:
 
- The name of your multiboot USB drive
- The language of SARDU
- The boot menu style (text or graphical)
- The boot menu timeout (the time in seconds before automatically booting into the default option)
- The default boot option (the operating system or tool that will be booted by default)
- The QEMU emulator settings (to test your multiboot USB drive without rebooting your computer)

You can also enable or disable some features such as:

- The autorun.inf file (to automatically run SARDU when inserting your multiboot USB drive into a 8cf37b1e13
