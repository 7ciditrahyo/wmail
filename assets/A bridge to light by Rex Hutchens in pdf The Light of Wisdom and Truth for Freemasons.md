A Bridge to Light is a book written by Rex Richard Hutchens, a 33rd degree Mason and a former Grand Master of Arizona. The book is intended as a guide to the degrees of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite of Freemasonry, from the 4th to the 33rd degree. The book explains the symbolism, history, and philosophy of each degree, as well as providing references to other sources of Masonic literature.
 
The book was first published in 1988 by the Supreme Council, 33rd degree, Southern Jurisdiction, U.S.A., the governing body of Scottish Rite Freemasonry in the United States. The book is not an official publication of the Supreme Council, but rather a personal work of the author. The book has been revised several times, with the latest edition published in 2010.

The Scottish Rite is one of the appendant bodies of Freemasonry that a Master Mason may join after completing the three degrees of the Blue Lodge. The Scottish Rite confers 29 additional degrees, from the 4th to the 32nd, each with its own ritual, lesson, and allegory. The 33rd degree is an honorary degree that is awarded by the Supreme Council to a select few Masons who have distinguished themselves in service to Freemasonry or society.
 
The Scottish Rite degrees are divided into four groups, or bodies: the Lodge of Perfection (4th to 14th degree), the Chapter of Rose Croix (15th and 16th degree), the Council of Kadosh (17th to 30th degree), and the Consistory (31st and 32nd degree). Each body has its own officers, regalia, and ceremonies. The degrees cover a wide range of topics, such as ancient mysteries, chivalry, philosophy, morality, religion, and patriotism.
