Muay Boran was developed as a martial art for self-defense and warfare, using the nine body weapons as well as weapons such as swords, spears, and clubs.

One of the most famous legends of Muay Boran is the story of Nai Khanomtom, a Siamese fighter who was captured by the Burmese army in 1767. The Burmese king wanted to see how Muay Boran compared to Lethwei, the Burmese martial art. He ordered Nai Khanomtom to fight against ten Burmese champions. Nai Khanomtom defeated them all with his superior skills and techniques, impressing the king and earning his freedom. This event is celebrated every year on March 17th as the National Muay Thai Day in Thailand.
 
Muay Boran evolved over time into different regional styles, such as Muay Chaiya, Muay Lopburi, Muay Korat, and Muay Thasao. Each style had its own characteristics and advantages, depending on the terrain and culture of the area. Muay Boran fighters were highly respected and some of them became royal guards or instructors for the army.
 
In the early 20th century, Muay Boran underwent a transformation into a modern sport, known as Muay Thai. The introduction of western boxing rules, gloves, rounds, and rings changed the way Muay Boran was practiced and taught. Some of the traditional techniques and aspects of Muay Boran were lost or modified to fit the new format. However, some masters and practitioners preserved and passed on the ancient art of Muay Boran to future generations.
