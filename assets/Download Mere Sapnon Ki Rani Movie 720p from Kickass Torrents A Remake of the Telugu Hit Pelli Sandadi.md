Cisco IOS images are software files that contain the operating system and features of Cisco network devices. They are used to emulate routers, switches, firewalls and other network devices in GNS3.
 
There are different types of Cisco IOS images, such as IOSv, IOSvL2, IOS XRv, ASAv and NX-OSv. Each type has different capabilities and limitations. You can find more information about them [here](https://docs.gns3.com/appliances/).

## Where to Get Cisco IOS Images for GNS3
 
Unfortunately, due to legal restrictions, GNS3 cannot provide Cisco IOS images. You will need to obtain them from other sources. Here are some options:
 
- **Cisco website:** If you have a valid service contract with Cisco, you can download IOS images directly from their website: [https://software.cisco.com/download/navigator.html](https://software.cisco.com/download/navigator.html). However, not all IOS images are compatible with GNS3. The only ones that work with the Dynamips emulator are the c7200 images (not the c7200p images!). The images for other platforms have been removed or are not supported by GNS3.
- **Cisco VIRL:** If you don't have a service contract with Cisco, you can purchase a VIRL license to get access to multiple IOS images that are very useful for GNS3 labs. The price starts at $199.99 per year for the Personal Edition: [http://virl.cisco.com/](http://virl.cisco.com/). You can use VIRL images without license authentication. You can download them from the VIRL portal and import them into GNS3.
- **Physical Cisco devices:** If you own a physical router or switch, you can copy the IOS image from the device and import it into GNS3. You will need a console cable and a TFTP server to do this. You can find more details [here](https://docs.gns3.com/docs/troubleshooting-faq/how-to-import-a-cisco-ios-image-into-gns3/).
- **Online sources:** There are some websites that offer free or paid downloads of Cisco IOS images for GNS3. However, these sources are not authorized by Cisco and may contain malware or viruses. We do not recommend using them and we are not responsible for any damage they may cause.

## How to Import Cisco IOS Images into GNS3
 
Once you have obtained the Cisco IOS images, you need to import them into GNS3. The process is different depending on the type of image you have.
 
For Dynamips images (such as c7200), you need to create a new router template and specify the path to the image file. You can follow these steps:

1. Open GNS3 and go to Edit > Preferences > Dynamips > IOS routers.
2. Click on New and select the platform and model of your image.
3. Browse to the location of your image file and select it.
4. Enter a name and an ID for your router template.
5. Adjust the RAM and other settings if needed.
6. Click on Next and Finish.

For QEMU images (such as IOSv, IOSvL2, ASAv), you need to create a new appliance template and specify the path to the image file. You can follow these steps:

1. Download the appliance file from the [GNS3 Marketplace](https://docs.gns3.com/appliances/).
2. Open GNS3 and go to File > Import appliance.
3. Browse to the location of your appliance file and select it 8cf37b1e13
