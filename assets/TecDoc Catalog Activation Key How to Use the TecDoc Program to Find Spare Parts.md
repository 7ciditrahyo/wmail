## How to Use TecDoc Catalogue Program
 
Once you have activated your TecDoc Catalogue program, you can start using it to find and compare spare parts for your vehicle. Here are some of the features and functions that you can use:

- **Vehicle selection:** You can select your vehicle by entering its VIN number, license plate number, or by choosing its make, model, and year from a list. You can also scan the VIN or barcode with your smartphone camera if you are using the TecDoc Catalogue App. TecDoc Catalogue will then show you all the compatible parts for your vehicle from various manufacturers and brands.

- **Product information:** You can view detailed information about each part, such as its specifications, features, images, videos, installation instructions, and cross-references. You can also compare different parts side by side and see their similarities and differences.
- **Dealer module:** You can find the nearest point of sale for the part you want by using the dealer module. TecDoc Catalogue will show you a map with the locations and contact details of the dealers who sell the part. You can also request a quote or place an order directly from the program.
